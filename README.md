# Lineone — Multipurpose Admin & Webapp UI Kit (Tailwind CSS)

## Project Overview

**Lineone** is a multipurpose admin and webapp UI kit built on Tailwind CSS. It offers modern dashboard layouts (orders, analytics, users, products), reusable components, visual consistency, and production-ready patterns so teams can ship admin consoles, SaaS dashboards, e-commerce back offices and internal tools quickly.

This repository contains the UI kit templates, component examples, sample data pages (orders dashboard), and guidance for turning the kit into a production webapp.

## Why this UI Kit (Value Proposition)

* **Fast shipping:** plug-and-play dashboard pages and components reduce build time by weeks.
* **Tailwind-first:** utility-driven styling for rapid customization and consistent design tokens.
* **Enterprise-ready patterns:** tables with filters, bulk actions, role-based UI patterns, and analytics cards ready for real data.
* **Investor / client friendly:** polished visuals and clear data surfaces that help stakeholders make decisions faster.

---

## Key Features

* Ready-made dashboard pages: Orders, Analytics, Users, Products, Settings.
* Reusable UI components: cards, tables, charts containers, filters, modals, forms, toasts.
* Responsive layout (desktop-first admin pattern that adapts to tablet/mobile).
* Tailwind CSS v3+ utility classes and example `tailwind.config.js`.
* Chart placeholders (Chart.js / ApexCharts integration examples).
* Dark & light mode-ready patterns.
* Example data tables with pagination, sorting and bulk actions.
* Design tokens and CSS variables for quick branding.

---

## Tech Stack & Tooling

* **Core:** HTML5 + Tailwind CSS (utility-first) + Vanilla JS (ES6)
* **Charts / Data viz:** Chart.js or ApexCharts (examples included)
* **Optional frontend:** React / Next.js or Vue if you want a componentized implementation
* **Build / Dev:** Node.js, npm, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, PurgeCSS (integrated via Tailwind)
* **Storage / API:** Suggested: Node/Express, NestJS or Laravel for backend; PostgreSQL or MongoDB for persistence

## Getting Started — Local Development

Copy and paste this into your terminal:

```bash
# 1) clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lineone-ui-kit.git
cd lineone-ui-kit

# 2) install deps (if package.json provided)
npm install

# 3) dev server (example using live-server)
npm run dev
# or using a simple static server:
npx live-server ./ --port=3000 --open=./dashboards-orders.html
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboards-orders.html`.

---

## NPM Scripts (example)

Add these to `package.json` to streamline development:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "live-server ./ --port=3000 --open=./dashboards-orders.html",
  "build:css": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify",
  "watch:css": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch",
  "optimize:images": "imagemin src/images/* --out-dir=dist/images",
  "lint:css": "stylelint '**/*.css'"
}
```

## Core Components & Pages

* **Header / Navbar:** user menu, quick search, global actions.
* **Sidebar:** collapsible, supports nested navigation and role-based items.
* **Orders Table:** server-side pagination hooks, multi-select, bulk status update, export CSV.
* **Analytics Cards:** KPIs with sparkline charts, trends and filters by date range.
* **Forms & Modals:** create/edit forms with validation patterns and inline errors.
* **Notifications:** toast system and real-time indicators (WebSocket/Socket.IO ready).
* **Settings / Profile:** user preferences, permissions and API key management.

## Data Models & API Examples (Orders Dashboard)

Example simplified data model and REST endpoints to pair the UI with a backend.

**Models (simplified)**:

```js
Order {
  id: UUID,
  number: string,
  customer: { id, name, email },
  items: [{ product_id, name, qty, price }],
  total: number,
  status: ["pending","processing","shipped","cancelled","completed"],
  created_at: datetime,
  updated_at: datetime
}
```

**API endpoints (examples)**:

```
GET /api/orders?status=processing&page=1&limit=25&search=smith
GET /api/orders/:id
POST /api/orders        # create order (if needed)
PUT /api/orders/:id     # update status, shipping info
DELETE /api/orders/:id  # admin only
GET /api/orders/export?format=csv
```

**Server-side patterns**:

* Use cursor or offset pagination depending on scale.
* Implement rate limiting and role-based access to order actions.
* Return lightweight DTOs for table rows and a full payload for detail pages.

---

## Theming & Tailwind Configuration

* Use `tailwind.config.js` to expose design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts).
* Keep a small CSS variables fallback for runtime color toggles (dark/light).
* Example token usage:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#0ea5a9',
        accent: '#7c3aed'
      },
      borderRadius: {
        xl: '1rem'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Recommend enabling JIT mode for ultra-fast builds and purge unused styles in production.

---

## Performance, Security & Accessibility

**Performance**

* Purge unused Tailwind classes in production build.
* Serve charts and heavy assets lazily; use WebP and a CDN.
* Inline critical CSS for first paint if needed.

**Security**

* Enforce HTTPS; use secure cookies; sanitize all inputs.
* Role-based access controls for admin actions and bulk operations.
* Protect export endpoints and large dataset access with throttling.

**Accessibility**

* Use semantic HTML for tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`).
* Ensure keyboard navigation for table rows, modals and dropdowns.
* Provide ARIA labels for interactive controls and color contrast compliance.

---

## Testing, QA & Monitoring

* Unit test critical utility functions (date formatting, bulk edits).
* E2E tests for workflows (Cypress / Playwright): order search, bulk status update, CSV export.
* Visual regression testing for admin UI (Percy or Playwright snapshot tests).
* Monitoring: Sentry for errors, Prometheus/Datadog for backend metrics.

---

## CI/CD & Deployment Recommendations

* Build step:

  * `npm ci` → `npm run build:css` → run linters → run tests → bundle assets
* Deploy static UI to a CDN-enabled host (Netlify, Vercel, S3+CloudFront).
* Deploy API to a managed host (Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS).
* Example GitHub Actions job:

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build:css
      - run: npm test
      - name: Deploy
        # deploy to target (Netlify/Vercel/rsync to server)
```

### Quick action items to ship this as a product

1. Replace placeholder links & contact info.
2. Add real API integration for Orders (mock or real).
3. Add a simple auth flow and role-based UI examples.
4. Configure Tailwind purge and production build.
5. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify + connect analytics + error tracking.

If you want, I can now:

* generate a ready `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`,
* produce a sample `server.js` with the orders API endpoints and sample data, or
* create a GitHub Actions YAML tuned to deploy the UI to Netlify.
